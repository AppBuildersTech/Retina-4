1. zero mean for all the stimulus or each part of it?
1. kernel for each bipolar or for the bipolar layer? if kernel for entire bipolar layer so we need just one radius not for each bipolar cell!
1. shwo connection between layers


1. nonlinear for each cell (for each connection)
1. weighted sum
1. fitted gaussian
1. ~~2d implementation (after reading papers)~~
1. two radius
